        <p><br>The multilayered latest entry in Hillerman’s long-running series featuring New Mexico Navajo investigators Joe Leaphorn, Jim Chee, and Bernadette Manuelito (after The Way of the Bear) is as vibrant as ever.
            <br><br>
            Tribal Police officer Manuelito is assigned to assist the FBI in their investigation of the explosion—which occurred in the a Navajo school Bowlegs was standing near—with police lieutenant Chee providing occasional support when he’s not tied up with administrative headaches or helping a local weaver keep her sheep safe from feral dogs.
            <br><br>
            The strongest parts of this tasting menu are those concerning the forced cultural assimilation of the “lost birds,” the Indigenous children adopted by non-Native parents.</p>

    <br>I just finished binging the complete TV series of White Collar before accepting this book for review, and I was still on my art heist kick. I love art so much. I was an art history minor in undergrad, and I love books dealing with art and artists and art lovers. Veridian Sterling Fakes It sounded like THE perfect book for me and I thought for sure I was going to love it! Unfortunately, it didn’t work out for me the way I had hoped. As always, my main points are bolded.
    <br><b>1.</b> First of all, I don’t think book knows what genre it’s supposed to be.
    <br><b>2.</b> The events in this book are a series of convenient coincidences that had nothing to do with the characters written.
    <br><b>3.</b> These characters are all extremely unlikable.
    <br><b>4.</b> Are the stakes in the room with us? 
    <br><b>5.</b> I did love the glimpses.
